Just practicing and playing around with some code
However, I have a challenge

When you put the website on desktop mode in a mobile device
Then you go to the abouts page
Then instantly return to the home page

The nav there will become disoriented

Please if you find a solution before I do
Do not hesistate to let me know
Thanks in advance.

Also,

I delibrately left some code to remind myself of certain somethings
Pls if you know a faster way to do the same things I did, do not hesistate to let me know!
Thanks in advance.
